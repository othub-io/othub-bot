Node runners also need to lock 50k+ TRAC to service asset publishers as collateral.\n\nTRAC is locked for the duration of a service (asset publishing), measured in Epoch (1 Epoch = 90 days), and is paid out in fractions at the end of each Epoch.\nTotal amount of TRAC currently locked in the ecosystem is verifiable through /networkstats or through other /commands.\n\nCost to publish 1 asset:\nCost = asset size (kB) * bid price * epochs * 3.\n\nPrivate assets with asset size below 1kB are rounded to 1.\nBid price is a price factor determined by the asset publisher which must be equal or above to the node ask price for the publishing to be successful. This is similar to market order books with buyers (bid) and sellers (ask).\nThe current market price is 0.01.\nThe current average Epoch length is 5, and each asset published is won by 3 nodes.\nWinners are chosen based on their XOR distance, ask price and stake size.",
